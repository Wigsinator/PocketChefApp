## Objective:
Build an android app that allows users to create, share, and download recipes from each other. The recipes should be accessed locally or externally through wi-fi. Creating or modifying recipes is done through filling out a recipe template.

## Personas: 
  - **Beth Smith**: *Is a 40-year-old mother who is passionate about cooking and in the past worked professionally in a kitchen, however due to family obligations couldn’t continue working. She wants to spark her passion again and wants to create and share her recipes with everyone. She is not tech savvy, so she wants an easy to use platform to share her recipes.* 
  
  - **Summer Smith**: *Is a 19-year-old 1st year university student that has recently moved out and is living on her own for the first time. She doesn’t know how to cook and buying meals is becoming expensive for her, hence she wants to cook at home. She doesn’t want to search through hundreds of recipes every time to find an easy recipe and wants to simply find a set of recipes that she can refer to anytime she wants to cook.*
  
## Scenarios:

1. Summer has a midterm the next day and she hasn’t eaten dinner yet. Going outside to eat will waste time as she needs to study for the midterm. Hence she opts to make something at home. However, Summer has very little cooking skill and needs to save time by finding a quick and easy recipe to make. She had found a recipe a week ago but forgot to bookmark the website, and last time she had done something slightly different but she doesn’t remember what she changed in the recipe. 

2. Beth hosted a party this weekend and she made all the food in the party from appetizers and drinks to the desserts. All the guests loved the food and many asked her for the recipes for the food. Beth thinks of an idea to make a website to post her recipes so all her guests can access it. She finds some website creating tools, however there is a monthly subscription required. Additionally, she finds out that it’s tedious to create, edit, and post recipes on the website as she needs to manually format and type out the recipe. She wants an easier and cheaper method to share and update her recipes with everyone.
  
## Principles: 

- **Ease of creating and editing recipes:** \
Users should feel that creating and editing recipes is quick and easy. Users should not have to worry about how to format the recipe and should just worry about the content of the recipe. 

- **Connecting Users:** 
\
Users should be able to share their recipes with ease and get feedback on their recipes through the rating system. Users who want to share their recipes should be connected to users who want to learn how to cook those recipes. Thus, connecting users with varied interests together. 

- **Ease of Managing Recipes:** 
\
Users should feel it is easy to manage all their recipes on the app and have the option of storing it locally on their device or externally stored via a DB and accessed through wi-fi.
