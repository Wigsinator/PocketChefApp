#### Reflect on how your team worked together. Here are a few questions that can guide you.

##### How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any? 
We use Google Doc to record everything we have planned for our project, and we make sure that everything is agreed upon by every team member. We also use Doodle Polls to determine availability of each team members for meetings and work sessions. And we use Whatsapp and Google Hangouts for communication.

##### How did you make decisions? 
Each team member will make suggestions and all team members will vote for ideas that they are interested in. Idea with most votes wins.

##### How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate? 
We evaluated whether the absence of certain features will significantly tarnish user experience with our application, if it does, we consider the feature to be high priority, otherwise, we consider it to be low priority. 
Priority, skills required, time it takes to implement and level of difficulty are the factors that were taken into account when we were deciding the points for each user stories. Tasks that only takes one step and can be implemented very easily were assigned with 1 point. For example, unit conversion of ingredients. On the other hand, other tasks such as sharing a recipe is assigned with more points accordingly.
We need roughly 2 rounds of voting to come to a consensus for the point estimate.

##### Did you meet in person or online? 
We have group calls through Google Hangouts as our primary way of meetings on Fridays (5-6PM) and we use Whatsapp for instant messages. We also have in person meetings during tutorials (TUT102 9-10am) at MN.

##### How frequently did you meet?
We meet at least once a week (whether itâ€™s online or in-person), usually twice a week.

##### What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
- Team members may have different understandings of user stories.
- Things may take longer than expected, so always plan things ahead of time.
