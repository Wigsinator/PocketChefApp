## **Methods of Communication:**
1. **Whatsapp Group Chat** Primary form of communication between meetings
2. **Google Hangouts:** Group calls for online meetings
3. **Google Docs:** Keep detailed records of meeting minutes and ideas between members
4. **Doodle Polls:** Determine availability of members for meetings and work sessions

## **Communication Response Times:**
- Confirmation of messages being received should be within 1 day. Even if you do not have the answer, at least acknowledge receipt of message.
- In the event of an approaching deadline, all members should aim for a maximum response time of 2 hours.
- If a member has an upcoming busy period during the semester, they should inform the rest of the team in the group chat as soon as possible.

## **Team Meetings:**
- **Online Meetings:**
    - Fridays 5-6pm on Google Hangouts 
    - This is the primary type of meeting for the team for updates, work, and brainstorming. 
- **Tutorial Meetings:** 
    - TUT0102 (MN 2266) - Thursdays 9-10am
    - This sccounts for formal Sprint meetings and weekly updates during sprints.
- **Submission Meetings:** 
    - Shortly before a deadline, the whole team should be present for these meetings to ensure proper and complete submissions. 
    - These meetings will cover the details and delegation of responsibilities regarding the material due for that week's sprint.


## **Recording Minutes for Meetings:**
- A Google Docs folder called "Minutes" will be available to be accessed by all members. 
- For every meeting, there will be 1 google doc created to record the minutes.
- All members will take turns writing the minutes during the project. We will refer to the past minutes records to determine which member will have the responsibility for the current meeting.

## **Meeting Preparation:**
- **In-Person Meetings:**
    - Most meetings will occur during TUT0102 on Thursdays.
    - Separate meeting details concerning the location, time, and who is responsible for room bookings will be decided in the Whatsapp group chat. 
- **Weekly Meetings:** 
    - Each member should be prepared to talk about what they have completed prior to the meeting, what will be worked on next, any issues faced, and whether they need any additional help from the team.

## **Version Control:**
### **General Commit Rules:**
    - Only commit and push files that you have edited.
    - Do not just push to master.
    - Do not commit executables if there are any.
    - Ensure that you conduct code review before pushing.
### **Commit Structure (https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) :**
    1. Separate the commit message subject from body with a blank line.
    2. Limit the commit message subject line to 50 characters. 
    3. Capitalize the commit message subject line. 
    4. Do not end the commit message subject line with a period. 
    5. Use the imperative mood in the commit message subject line: 
        i.e. describe what the commit message does (in present tense) if you apply the commit. 
    6. Wrap the commit message body at 72 characters. 
    7. Use the commit message body to explain what and why vs. how.

## **Roles & Division of Work:**
- **Dividing Work:** 
    - Work will be ideally divided based on an individual's strengths and group consensus. 
    - Work will also be divided as evenly as possible given a person's circumstances.
- **Roles:** 
    - Roles will be identified prior to dividing the work and will reflect the current sprint of the project.
    - The magnitude of the roles should not dictate any hierarchy and should ensure equality between all members.

## **Submitting Sprint Deliverables & Software:**
- **Pre-Submission Deadlines**:
    - Each member will aim to complete their tasks by the latest Monday before the due date. This will allow the team to debug and merge code together.
    - This deadline is flexible to account for unexpected problems/bugs.
    - When the code is completed, we will work on preparing the presentation.
- **Submission Meeting**:
    - This meeting will occur before the sprint deadline, and the whole team must be present. This meeting will cover submission details and responsbility delegation.
- **Submission Checks**:
    - Every member is responsible for conducting a brief review of the submission to ensure nothing is missed.
    - Additionally, 2 people will be assigned the job of conduting a detailed review of the submission per sprint. The team members will take turns filling in this role.

## **Contingency Plans:**
- **If A Member Leaves/Drops The Course:**
    - Contact Ilir as soon as possible.
    - Evenly divide the leaving member's workload amongst the remaining group members.
- **Missed Meetings:**
    - In the event a member misses a meeting, they should read through the relevant minutes for the meeting.
    - If something comes up last minute, the team should be given a heads up in the Whatsapp group chat.
- **Missed Deadlines:**
    - To avoid missed deadlines, we will have periodic check-ins in the group chat to determine individual progress of tasks and evaluate priorities to ensure timely completion.
    - If work was not completed by the Monday before the official deadline, another team member will be assigned to help complete the task.
- **Academic Integrity:**
    - **NOTE:** If using someone else's code, remember to properly reference it and make sure everyone in the team is informed.
    - If work is found to be blatantly copied from elsewhere, the issue will be raised to the Instructor and the department. Additionally, the copied code will be removed from the project.
