## Practices to Keep from this Sprint:

The best practice that we implemented in this sprint is that we met up twice a week for meetings. We utilized Whatsapp for immediate conversation, teams for project document sharing and Google Hangouts for voice call in meetings. By having meetings more often we were able to determine pitfalls or struggles more easily, and make tentative deadlines much more easily.

## New Practices to Adopt for Next Sprint:

1. Be more careful with **GIT**: Most of the team uses git in a limited way where the structure is not necessarily enforced. So for the next sprint we need to be more mindful in creating the branches for user stories and tasks. Additionally, it was really easy to miss the naming convention for git commits, so the entire team needs to more careful.
2. Task Structure and Deadlines: A lot of the tasks for the user story was uneven in terms of scope and there did not need to be so many. For the next sprint we should be more diligent in terms of creating tasks and setting deadlines to finish them so that we're not rushing to finish everything close to the deadline.
3. The Presenter part of the Architecture links the Model and the View, so we need to try and get the Model and View finished before the Presenter to make integration between all parts much easier.
4. **Do more Standups!** A lot of standups were done in the night before midnight and were quite rushed. We need to utilize these standups as small check-ins to see where everyone's progress is and interact with each other during this time. We should set a time in the day to post the standups so that ideally no individual member misses the standup and if they do miss the time, then we can send reminders early enough in the day.

## Harmful Practices to Avoid for Next Sprint:

1. It's fair that everyone has assignments for other courses, but it was difficult having to condense all the learning and work into a shorter amount of time. This made it difficult for integration and members were at different levels of understanding. 
2. It's hard to work on code that doesn't work so we need to avoid NOT testing code before commiting them to a branch. Each individual part should ideally work in regards to what is needed prior to committing.

## Best & Worst Experience from this Sprint:

Since all of us are new to Android Studio and Firebase, we had to learn these technologies on our own time. This can be a blessing and a curse at the same time. It was super rewarding solving a problem based on your knowledge and learning as you go. It really demonstrates an understanding that is deeper than just regurgitating code that you find on the internet. However, it can be incredibly frustrating to learn new programs when the program in question is very complicated or finicky. The worst part is dealing the random errors or build fails that occurred in Android Studio. Also, Android Studio is constantly worked on so some solutions that may have worked in 2018 will not work today.
