 Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that worked well for your team. Explain why.
- We split sprints into phases so we could accurately work on tasks that we knew the team could handle.
- Two people (presenter and model) worked as a small team on specific user stories, allowing more tasks to be completed.
- By having multiple meetings each week, it was easier to check in and adjust the workload and direction of the sprint.
- Having the View completed first allowed better workflow for the Presenter team since they would not have to wait to start working.
- Coordinating presenter/model/view through interfaces allowed for easier unit testing.

Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that didn't work well for your team. Explain why.
- Storing recipes in RoomDB, steeper learning curve compared to Firebase and did not allow storing lists which means we would have had to find an alternative way to place to store recipe ingredients and steps, as well as not allowing for syncing between devices
- Having each member creating a new post every standup made it difficult to track who already made a post. As a result, fewer reminders to members who forgot were sent out in earlier sprints
- A lack of clarity and checking the user stories other people worked on led to confusion as to what certain user stories were actually intended to do. This was resolved through increasing our communication skills, and going through the remaining user stories as a group.

If you had to continue working as a team, and design your process, what would your process look like? In other words, describe an ideal process __for your team__, based on your experience working together.
- We would continue having 2 meetings each week to touch base and having at least 5 daily stand ups per sprint to keep the whole team updated on the progress being made
- For any major decisions, we would have a team vote and agreement. This worked well for this project as it ensured everyoneâ€™s opinion was being heard 
- Since the view code dictates what IDs are being used for the components, an ideal process would be to have the View code be completed first. This would allow the people working on the presenter to know what ID to use in order to reference a certain UI component. 
- During sprint planning meetings, the scope and understanding of the user story should be clarified. We ran into some issues stemming from miscommunications we had over what certain user stories were. These issues could have been prevented by ensuring everyone was on the same page at the beginning of the sprint.
