## Practices to Keep from this Sprint: 

We have continued to have Google Hangout meetings twice a week and have continued to communicate by text messaging via WhatsApp. By having meetings weekly, we keep in touch with the progress of the project and to hash out any problems we encounter. We have made better use of git by branching subtasks and merging to make a user story branch. Additionally, we have made sure to test out code before pushing it on GitHub. We split our sprint into phases where we work on certain stories. This keeps everyone around the same page and prevents different groups from jumping ahead and working on user stories that cannot be completed.

## New Practices to Adopt for the Next Sprint (if we continued): 

1.	Meeting Deadlines: We missed a few tentative deadlines we set for ourselves to complete certain tasks by. For the next sprint we should really try and meet the deadlines we set, so the project remains on track to get finished. 
2.	More "standups": While we're being marked for our 5 standups, we realized that some user stories may take longer and require more work. So we want more mini-standups in the Whatsapp group chat in order to update the rest of the team on the progress.

## Harmful Practices to Avoid for Next Sprint (if we continued): 

1. Pushing deadlines repeatedly means we put pressure on ourselves towards the end of the sprint to finish, hence we must schedule our work better so that thereâ€™s less work left towards the end of the sprint.

## Best & Worst Experience from this Sprint: 

Our best experience was near the end of the sprint when we were testing our app. It was super rewarding to see things working as they intended and with user stories together. It can be satisfying to see one user story working but all of them in conjunction with each other is really satisfying. It made our work all worth it.

Our worst experience is being stressed about having a back up plan in case things do not go according to plan. There were some aspects in the sprint where we needed to change our plan in the middle which put more work on other team members. It is never a nice feeling to know that we have to add work onto people at the very last minute.
