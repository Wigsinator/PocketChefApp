## Practices to Keep from this Sprint: 

We have continued to have Google Hangout meetings twice a week and have continued to communicate by text messaging via WhatsApp. By having meetings weekly, we keep in touch with the progress of the project and to hash out any problems we encounter. We have made better use of git by branching subtasks and merging to make a user story branch. Additionally, we have made sure to test out code before pushing it on GitHub. We additionally split our sprint into phases where we work on certain stories. This keeps everyone around the same page and prevents different groups from jumping ahead and working on user stories that cannot be completed.

## New Practices to Adopt for the Next Sprint: 

1.	Meeting Deadlines: We missed a few tentative deadlines we set for ourselves to complete certain tasks by. For the next sprint we should really try and meet the deadlines we set, so the project remains on track to get finished. 
2.	More "standups": While we're being marked for our 5 standups, we realized that some user stories may take longer and require more work. So we want more mini-standups in the Whatsapp group chat in order to update the rest of the team on the progress.
3.  More open communication about understanding: Misinterpretations of user stories occurred quite a bit, so we need to communication and discuss the scope of the user stories in the beginning of the sprint or phase so everyone is on the same page.

## Harmful Practices to Avoid for Next Sprint: 

1. Pushing deadlines repeatedly means we put pressure on ourselves towards the end of the sprint to finish, hence we must schedule our work better so that thereâ€™s less work left towards the end of the sprint.
2. Arguments: Things were a bit tense with some tasks and user stories because of misunderstandings and misinterpretations. This caused a lot of tension and reduced grouple morale. We need to be more open with communication in order to prevent this.

## Best & Worst Experience from this Sprint: 

Our best experience was changing the database from RoomDB to Firebase. Firebase is a lot more user friendly and easier to use so we were able to get parts of our app working much faster than before. It was extremely rewarding to see parts of the app working as intended with little to no bugs. 

Our worst experience were the arguments that occurred. It added a lot of stress and discomfort for everyone involved. It is never easy to complete group work when everyone disagrees with what the work needs to be done is defined as. While we resolved the differences, it was definitely an avoidable situation that hopefully will not occur at all during the next sprint.
