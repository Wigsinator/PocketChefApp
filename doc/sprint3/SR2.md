## Practices to Keep from this Sprint: 

We have continued to have Google Hangout meetings twice a week and have continued to communicate by text messaging via WhatsApp. By having meetings weekly, we keep in touch with the progress of the project and to hash out any problems we encounter. We have made better use of git by branching subtasks and merging to make a user story branch. Additionally, we have made sure to test out code before pushing it on GitHub. Overall, we have to keep communicating with each other and continue good version control practices. 

## New Practices to Adopt for the Next Sprint: 

1.	Meeting Deadlines: We missed a few tentative deadlines we set for ourselves to complete certain tasks by. For the next sprint we should really try and meet the deadlines we set, so the project remains on track to get finished. 
2.	Evaluate the use of a new technology: This sprint we started to use roomDB as our local storage solution, however we have come to realize the limitations and complexity of using it later in the project. Hence, we must evaluate the future consequences and complications of the technologies we are using before going to deep in the implementation. 
3.	We should comment more on the classes and methods we use as it makes it easier for everyone to read the code and know its purpose. 

## Harmful Practices to Avoid for Next Sprint: 

1.	Some commented out code was pushed to master; we should remove commented out code on master as it serves no purpose and may confuse us in the future. 
2.	Pushing deadlines repeatedly means we put pressure on ourselves towards the end of the sprint to finish, hence we must schedule our work better so that thereâ€™s less work left towards the end of the sprint. 

## Best & Worst Experience from this Sprint: 
Our best experience in this sprint is having a running app where a user can login and create a recipe. This is good because all of us started out not knowing anything about Android Studio to now knowing how to create a running app with using an architecture and multiple design patterns. This sprint showed us how we can work on various part individually but in the end connect them together to form a running app. Our worst experience is having to scrap the idea of using roomDB for local storage. RoomDB will cause more work and more chances for errors to occur in the future as after adding multi-user online storage, we will need to facilitate how to sync data locally and on the cloud. This poses a problem as roomDB uses a different format and method for storing data compared to Firebase which we will use for online storage. Hence, our worst experience is putting efforts into something then having to completely scrap it.
